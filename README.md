# Pasadena Astronomy Postdoc Retreat (PAPR) 2019


## Pre-retreat hike

Similar to the past two years, we are considering an optional pre-retreat hike in the morning before the retreat. The [Sawmill Road Loop Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/sawmill-road-loop-trail) is only 3 miles long, features wonderful views, and is just a 5-minute drive from the conference center. 

# What is PAPR?

The purpose of this annual informal meeting is to bring together postdocs from the various astrononomy institutes in Pasadena (Carnegie, Caltech Astro/GPS, IPAC, JPL, UCLA, and UCR), and to get to know each other's science. Building on previous years' experience, the retreat is an opportunity to cross institutional boundaries, foster new collaborations, and enrich the experience of being an astronomy postdoc in the City of Astronomy.

This year's retreat will be held on May 1st-3rd 2019. The program included a mix of brief research talks by attendees, 3-4 career development talks by our invited speakers, and several social gatherings.

# Registration

The registration fee is $560 per person.
Carnegie funded 100% of the cost of the retreat for its postdocs. 
Caltech astronomy funded 50% of the cost of the retreat for its postdocs. The rest of the funding have to come from the postdoc's travel funds.
For the other institutions, there was unfortunately no funding available for this year's retreat, and thus 100% had to come from the personal travel fund.
